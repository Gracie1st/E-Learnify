Challenge:
 
The E-learnify project is intended to solve the problem of limited access to quality education, especially in underserved areas. The project aims to provide a comprehensive online education system that is accessible to learners of all ages, regardless of their location or socioeconomic background.
 
The Portfolio Project will not solve all the challenges facing education, such as lack of access to technology or funding for education. However, it can provide a useful tool to increase access to quality education for those who have access to the internet.
 
The Portfolio Project will help learners of all ages, from young children to adults who want to continue their education or learn new skills. The users of E-learnify will be people who are interested in learning and improving their skills, regardless of their location or background.
 
This project is not dependent on a specific locale, as it is designed to be accessible to anyone with an internet connection.
 
Risks:
 
Technical risks:
 
There may be compatibility issues between the different technologies we are using.
There may be performance issues if the website experiences high traffic.
We may encounter security vulnerabilities if we do not implement proper security measures.
To mitigate these risks, we will conduct thorough testing and implement security best practices.
 
Non-technical risks:
 
There may be copyright or intellectual property issues if we use content without proper permission or attribution.
There may be communication or coordination issues within the team that could lead to delays or misunderstandings.
To prevent these negative outcomes, we will implement a clear communication plan and establish procedures for obtaining permission and attribution for any third-party content used on the website.
 
Infrastructure:
 
Branching and merging: We will use the GitHub flow for branching and merging. This involves creating feature branches off of the main branch and merging them back into the main branch once they are complete and tested.
 
Deployment: We will use Heroku for deployment, as it is a simple and cost-effective solution for deploying web applications.
 
Populating app with data: We will use a combination of manually collated data
Existing Solutions:
Coursera offers courses from top universities and companies around the world, while Udacity specializes in tech-related courses and offers nano-degrees. Udemy offers a range of courses on various topics, while edX is a non-profit platform that offers courses from top universities. The main similarity between these platforms is that they offer online courses, but they differ in terms of their course offerings, target audiences, pricing, and teaching methodologies.
